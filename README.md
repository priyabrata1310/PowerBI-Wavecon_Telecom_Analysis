## Insights:

**1.** Revenue declined by 0.6% after the 5G launch which impacted the cities like Delhi, Chennai, and Ahmedabad.

**2.** The top performing cities after the 5G launch in terms of revenue change% are Lucknow, Gurgaon, and Patna.

**3.** Raipur stands at top with highest ARPU change% i.e., 22.25% after the implementation of 5G.

**4.** Pune & Lucknow stands at top in terms of TAU growth % even after the TUsU change% is highest in these cities.

**5.** Even though Wavecon Telecom holds its market position but it lost its market share by 2%.

**6.** P1 is the top performing plan after the 5G launch.

## Recommendations:

**1.** 3G/4G services must be discontinued after the 5G launch.

**2.** Proper feedback must be obtained from the unsubscribed users to identify the reason behind it.

**3.** A survey must be carried out in the Tier 2 cities to identify the reason behind increase in unsubscribed users.

**4.** Stay informed with the market trends through competitive analysis and attract new users through new offerings in the existing services.

**5.** Provide promotional offers to the users in the new market which has the potential to grow in the upcoming time.
